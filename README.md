# Music-For-All

YU Hackathon 2022

<pre>
Our project attempted to make the connection between music and those who can’t listen to music and its messages due to their physical disabilities.   It is specifically for those who might want to deliver a song’s message to someone who can not hear- through sign language. Lyrics of a song is translated into sign language with pictures to follow. This way you can now “sing” to someone who can not hear singing.
