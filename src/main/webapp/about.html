                <h1>Delivery of Music to All</h1>
                <p>Our project attempted to make the connection between music<br/> and those who can’t listen to music<br/> and its messages due to their physical disabilities. </p>
                <p>It is specifically for those who might want to deliver a song’s message to someone <br/>who can not hear- through sign language.<br/> Lyrics of a song is translated into sign language with pictures to follow.<br/> This way you can now “sing” to someone who can not hear singing.</p>
